    "<b>What is Probability</b>\n",
    "- Probability is simply how likely an event will occur.\n",
    "- Whenever we're unsure about the outcome of an event, we can talk about the probabilities of how likely certain outcomes will occur.\n",
    "- An important skill for data scientists using data affected by chance.\n",
    "  \n",

    "<b>Why Probability?</b>  \n",
    "- With randomness existing everywhere, the use of probability theory allows for the analysis of chance events.\n",
    "- Our Aim is to determine the likelihood of an event occuring, often using a numerical scale of between 0 and 1. With the number '0' indicating impossibility & '1' indicating certainty.\n",
    "- Example: Tossing a coin has 50% probability for heads.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - If a business enterprise expects to receive between 500k and 700k in revenue each month, the linear graph will begin with 500k at the low end and end with 700k at the high end. For a typical probability distribution, the graph will resemble a bell curve, where the least likely outcomes fall nearer the extreme ends of the range and the most likely, nearer to the midpoint of the extremes.  \n",
