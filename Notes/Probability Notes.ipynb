    "<b>What is Probability</b>\n",
    "- Probability is simply how likely an event will occur.\n",
    "- Whenever we're unsure about the outcome of an event, we can talk about the probabilities of how likely certain outcomes will occur.\n",
    "- An important skill for data scientists using data affected by chance.\n",

    "- With randomness existing everywhere, the use of probability theory allows for the analysis of chance events.\n",
    "- Our Aim is to determine the likelihood of an event occuring, often using a numerical scale of between 0 and 1. With the number '0' indicating impossibility & '1' indicating certainty.\n",

For a typical probability distribution, the graph will resemble a bell curve, where the least likely outcomes fall nearer the extreme ends of the range and the most likely, nearer to the midpoint of the extremes.  \n",
